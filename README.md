# Calculator

A simple broweser based Calculator. I'm doing this project while following through the Odin Project foundations course. The goal of the project is to work on implementing some of the Javascript logic learned and also stylize with HTML and CSS.

### Thoughts
---
Definitely a solid task of a project. There's quite a lot I would like to change, but the project overall was a great exercise to practice Javascript.

### Current State

* It does work, but the functionality is not quite where I want it. My main issue is actually how regular calculators work; after comparing several different simple calculators almost everyone of them had their own quirks that made getting a precise logic without the use of a parser of some sort very finniky

* In order to work around this I opted to code a lot of the logic in a way that is deeply coupled. This is the main reason I've left out some functionality, such as dynamic precision based on number of digits shown and the addition of a decimal button. Both of these would require rewriting the logic entirely to avoid writing code for all the unique cases so I'll leave it for later.

## For the Future

This one mostly speaks for itself, I'll come back and add keyboard functionality as well as decimal and dynamicly precise digits but for now it will wait.
